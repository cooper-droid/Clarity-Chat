# Retirement: Redefined

## A New Framework for Modern Retirement Planning

For decades, retirement planning has been framed around a simple question: "How much money do I need?" But that question misses the bigger picture. At Fiat Wealth Management, we believe retirement isn't just about accumulating enough—it's about creating clarity, confidence, and control over your financial future.

**Retirement: Redefined** is our proprietary framework that transforms how you think about and plan for retirement. Instead of focusing solely on net worth, we guide you through three critical questions:

### 1. Where Are You Today?

Before making any decisions, you need clarity on your current situation:

- What are your current income sources and expenses?
- What assets do you have, and how are they structured (taxable, tax-deferred, tax-free)?
- What are your health considerations and family dynamics?
- What are your goals, values, and concerns?

**Most people jump to solutions before understanding their situation.** We help you build a complete picture first.

### 2. What Options Align with Your Goals?

Once we understand where you are, we explore the full range of strategies available:

- **Tax optimization**: Roth conversions, tax-gain harvesting, strategic withdrawals
- **Income planning**: Social Security timing, pension elections, systematic distributions
- **Healthcare planning**: Medicare decisions, IRMAA management, long-term care
- **Legacy planning**: Estate structuring, charitable giving, wealth transfer

**Every decision involves tradeoffs.** We help you understand the pros and cons of each approach so you can make informed choices aligned with your priorities.

### 3. What's the Next Best Step?

Planning is worthless without action. We create a concrete roadmap:

- Prioritized action items for the next 6-12 months
- Clear decision timelines and milestones
- Coordination with your tax and legal advisors
- Regular reviews and adjustments as life changes

**Retirement planning isn't a one-time event—it's an ongoing process.** We're with you every step of the way.

## Why This Approach Works

Traditional retirement planning often fails because it:
- Focuses on accumulation without a distribution strategy
- Ignores tax efficiency in the withdrawal phase
- Treats Social Security and Medicare as afterthoughts
- Fails to adapt as circumstances change

**Retirement: Redefined** flips this model. We start with your goals and work backward to create a sustainable, tax-efficient strategy that gives you confidence in every decision.

## Common Scenarios We Address

### The Tax Time Bomb
You've diligently saved in your 401(k) and IRA, but now you're facing massive Required Minimum Distributions (RMDs) that push you into high tax brackets and trigger IRMAA surcharges. We help you defuse this bomb through strategic Roth conversions and tax planning.

### The Social Security Dilemma
Should you claim at 62, wait until Full Retirement Age, or delay until 70? The "right" answer depends on your health, other income sources, spousal benefits, and longevity assumptions. We model every scenario.

### The Business Owner Exit
You've built a successful business and are ready to sell. How do you manage the tax hit? How do you replace your income? How do you ensure the proceeds last? We specialize in liquidity event planning.

### The Healthcare Gap
You want to retire before 65, but Medicare doesn't start until then. How do you bridge the gap? What about rising healthcare costs in retirement? We build comprehensive healthcare strategies.

## Getting Started

The first step is a **Clarity Call**—a complimentary conversation where we:
1. Understand your current situation and goals
2. Identify your biggest planning gaps or concerns
3. Explain how our process works
4. Determine if we're a good fit to work together

No pressure, no sales pitch—just clarity.
