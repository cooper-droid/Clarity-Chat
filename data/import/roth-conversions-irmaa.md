# Roth Conversions and IRMAA: A Strategic Guide

## Understanding the Intersection of Roth Conversions and Medicare Costs

One of the most powerful retirement tax strategies—Roth conversions—can have an unintended consequence: triggering higher Medicare premiums through IRMAA (Income-Related Monthly Adjustment Amount). Understanding this relationship is critical for effective planning.

## What Are Roth Conversions?

A Roth conversion involves moving money from a traditional IRA or 401(k) to a Roth IRA. You pay taxes on the converted amount now, but enjoy tax-free growth and withdrawals later.

**Key benefits:**
- Tax-free growth for the rest of your life
- No Required Minimum Distributions (RMDs) from Roth IRAs
- Tax-free inheritance for beneficiaries
- Hedge against future tax rate increases
- Reduce future taxable income (and therefore IRMAA exposure)

**The catch:**
- You must pay income tax on the converted amount in the year of conversion
- Large conversions can push you into higher tax brackets
- Large conversions can trigger IRMAA surcharges if you're on Medicare

## What Is IRMAA?

IRMAA is a surcharge added to your Medicare Part B and Part D premiums if your income exceeds certain thresholds.

**2024 IRMAA Thresholds (based on 2022 income):**

| Modified Adjusted Gross Income | Part B Monthly Premium | Part D Monthly Premium Addition |
|--------------------------------|------------------------|----------------------------------|
| Individual < $103,000 / Couple < $206,000 | $174.70 (standard) | $0 |
| Individual $103,000-$129,000 / Couple $206,000-$258,000 | $244.60 | $12.90 |
| Individual $129,000-$161,000 / Couple $258,000-$322,000 | $349.40 | $33.30 |
| Individual $161,000-$193,000 / Couple $322,000-$386,000 | $454.20 | $53.80 |
| Individual $193,000-$500,000 / Couple $386,000-$750,000 | $559.00 | $74.20 |
| Individual > $500,000 / Couple > $750,000 | $594.00 | $81.00 |

**Key points:**
- IRMAA is based on income from two years prior (2024 premiums based on 2022 tax return)
- Conversions count as income for IRMAA purposes
- IRMAA surcharges last for one year, then reset based on the next year's income
- Appeals are possible for life-changing events

## The Strategic Challenge

Here's the dilemma: Roth conversions can help you avoid IRMAA in the long run by reducing future taxable income, but they can trigger IRMAA in the short run if you're already on Medicare.

### Example Scenario

**John and Mary, both 68:**
- Combined income: $180,000/year (mostly from RMDs and Social Security)
- Current IRMAA bracket: Second tier ($206,000-$258,000)
- Additional Medicare cost: ~$1,700/year above standard premiums

They want to convert $100,000 from their IRA to a Roth IRA. This would:
- Add $100,000 to their taxable income for the conversion year
- Push them into the fourth IRMAA tier two years later
- Cost them an extra ~$5,000 in Medicare premiums that year
- But reduce their future RMDs by ~$4,000/year, potentially avoiding IRMAA entirely in later years

**Is it worth it?** That depends on their long-term tax situation, life expectancy, and how they value tax-free flexibility.

## Strategic Approaches

### 1. Convert Before Medicare (Ages 60-65)
The "sweet spot" for Roth conversions is often the years between retirement and Medicare enrollment:
- You may have lower income (not yet taking Social Security or RMDs)
- Conversions won't affect Medicare premiums yet
- You maximize years of tax-free growth

**Checklist:**
- Project your future RMDs and tax brackets
- Estimate your Medicare IRMAA exposure without conversions
- Model multi-year conversion strategies to stay in target tax brackets
- Consider doing larger conversions before age 63 (when IRMAA lookback begins)

### 2. Strategic Partial Conversions While on Medicare
If you're already on Medicare, you can still convert—just be strategic:
- Convert only up to IRMAA thresholds (not over them)
- Spread conversions over multiple years
- Time conversions around other income events (e.g., avoid conversion in a year you sell property)

### 3. Accept Short-Term IRMAA for Long-Term Benefit
Sometimes it makes sense to take the IRMAA hit:
- If you have a large IRA and your future RMDs will keep you in high IRMAA brackets anyway
- If you expect tax rates to rise significantly
- If you want to leave tax-free assets to heirs

**Calculate the breakeven:** Does the long-term tax savings exceed the short-term IRMAA cost?

### 4. IRMAA Appeals for Life-Changing Events
You can appeal IRMAA if you experienced:
- Retirement or reduced work hours
- Loss of income-producing property
- Divorce or death of spouse
- Loss of pension

If approved, your IRMAA is recalculated based on current income, not two-year-old income.

## Common Mistakes to Avoid

1. **Converting without considering IRMAA**: Always model the Medicare impact before converting
2. **Over-converting in a single year**: Spreading conversions reduces both tax and IRMAA spikes
3. **Ignoring other income sources**: Don't forget capital gains, bonuses, or property sales
4. **Failing to coordinate with Social Security timing**: Delaying Social Security can create a conversion window
5. **Not reviewing annually**: Income thresholds and personal circumstances change

## The Bottom Line

Roth conversions and IRMAA planning require a **holistic, multi-year view** of your retirement tax situation. There's no one-size-fits-all answer—it depends on:
- Your current and projected income
- Your age and health
- Your IRA balances and future RMDs
- Your Social Security claiming strategy
- Your tax rate expectations
- Your legacy goals
